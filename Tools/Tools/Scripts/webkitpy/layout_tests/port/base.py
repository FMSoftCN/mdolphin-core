# Python's Popen has a bug that causes any pipes opened to a
# process that can't be executed to be leaked.  Since this
# code is specifically designed to tolerate exec failures
# to gracefully handle cases where wdiff is not installed,
# the bug results in a massive file descriptor leak. As a
# workaround, if an exec failure is ever experienced for
# wdiff, assume it's not available.  This will leak one
# file descriptor but that's better than leaking each time
# wdiff would be run.
